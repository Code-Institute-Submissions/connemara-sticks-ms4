      <p> Michael learned how to cut his first stick from his late father, and other stick makers.
        After a career in the defence forces, Michaels love for stickmaking has become more than just a hobby but a
        passion of his. This can be seen in the detail that goes into each piece.</p>

        <p>All our raw material is sourced and cut by ourselves throughout the lands of Ireland. Our countryside is full
          of woodlands, mountains, rivers and streams- ideal locations for the trees and bushes to thrive and grow. </p>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-clock d-none d-sm-inline"></i> SEASONING </h3>
        <p>After cutting our sticks, not much is done to them for a minimum of 12 months. Depending on the wood they can
          sometime be left to season for two years. Our sticks are cut normally during October to Late February.

        <p>Our designs are more for working stick rather than a show stick. We take pride that our sticks are light,
          strong and like an extra arm to whoever is using it.</p>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler d-none d-sm-inline"></i> FINISH</h3>
        <p>A stick needs to be finished with the best quality of varnish or stain. All ours are carefully prepared
          before apply the varnish. They are left to dry before a second coat is applied.</p>
